A half size micromouse project

Over time, this will grow into a fully described project for an open source, half-sized micromouse designed by members of the UK Micromouse and Robotics Society (UKMARS).

The project will include full hardware details and demonstration software that will provide all the basic functions needed to run the robot in a contest maze.
